    Bug 2127798_: Automatic S3 credential update when EC2 credentials are rotated

    Glance now automatically updates S3 image location URLs when EC2 credentials
    are rotated in Keystone. Previously, images with S3 locations would become
    inaccessible after credential rotation, requiring manual intervention to update
    location metadata. This fix ensures seamless credential rotation without
    breaking image access.
